This project was created with the purpose of developing a better recommendation algorithm for animes based on what myanimelist website users have demonstrated. 
Currently, the only recommendations that exist are based on user reviews suggesting other animes.

Frontend: The frontend was created using react and is currently being hosted by azure web static web services.

Backend: The backend is all written in python and hosted in Azure 

Algorithm: The recommendation algorithm is currently using content-based collaborative filtering based on user reviews. The user data was acquired using the official beta and unofficial myanimelist APIs 
and stored in a cosmos (nosql) database. 

Future features:
- user-based collaborative filtering recommendation based on user's myanimelist account
- Recommendations based on written reviews content association using bag of words model.
